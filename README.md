# Epilepsy disease Early Warning  Using With Machine Learning AlgorithmsÂ Approaches
# Epilepsy
Epilepsy may occur as a result of a genetic disorder or an acquired brain injury, such as a trauma or stroke. During a seizure, a person experiences abnormal behaviour, symptoms and sensations, sometimes including loss of consciousness. There are few symptoms between seizures. Epilepsy is usually treated by medication and in some cases by surgery, devices or dietary changes.

# Seizure
A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain. A seizure usually affects how a person appears or acts for a short time. Many different things can occur during a seizure. Whatever the brain and body can do normally can also occur during a seizure.

# Problem Statement
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which can significantly impact the quality of life for affected individuals. Early prediction and intervention can help manage the condition more effectively, reducing the risk of severe seizures and their associated consequences. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the onset of epileptic seizures in individuals with epilepsy, allowing for timely interventions and better disease management.

# Data Collection
By conducting survey we have collected data. Dataset link : https://github.com/shivanipoosala/Epilepsy_Prediction_dataset

# Dataset
Dataset Description of Epilepsy Prediction

This is the data set of Early Prediction of Epilepsy Using ML which consist of 21 columns and 1774 rows In the data set the dependent variable is Affected.

*FirstName & LastName: This is generally irrelevant for prediction and can be kept as an identifier.

*Age: The individual's age, which can be an important factor because epilepsy affects different age groups differently.

*Gender: As epilepsy might have gender-specific features, gender may be included within the analysis.(Female=0 & Male=1)

*Weight: While weight is not a strong predictor, it can be included in a comprehensive model.

*Heredity :A family history of epilepsy is an important predictor.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Diabetes: The presence of diabetes could raise the risk of epilepsy.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Asthma: The presence of asthma, which may be a risk factor for health.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Drug Consumption: The use of specific medicines may influence the risk of epilepsy.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Alcohol Consumption: In certain situations, alcohol use may be related to epilepsy.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal imbalances, particularly in women, can increase the risk of epilepsy.(Yes=1&No=0) 

*Stress: High levels of stress can be a role.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Blood Pressure: High or low blood pressure may be related to epilepsy.(Low=0, Medium=1& High=2)

*Fever: Frequent fevers could be an indication or a trigger.(Low=0, Medium=1& High=2)

*Lack of sleep: can be a seizure trigger for certain people.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Heart Stroke: A history of heart stroke may be useful medical history.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Brain Tumor: The presence of brain tumors can increase the risk of epilepsy.(No=0,Stage=1,2,3,4)

*Brain Injuries: Past brain injuries may raise the risk of epilepsy.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Frequent Consumption of Junk Food: Dietary habits may have an impact on overall health.(Yes=1&No=0)

*Seizures Time Duration: The duration of epilepsy(seizures).(No=0,less than 30sec=1,2-3mins=2 &more than 5mins=3)

*Affected: the occurrence of epileptic (seizures).(Yes=1&No=0)
